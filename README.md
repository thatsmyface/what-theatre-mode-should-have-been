# what-theatre-mode-should-have-been
A greasemonkey script to make Twitch's theatre mode automatically enter fullscreen when opened and leave fullscreen when closed.

Note: Currently only works on Firefox (cuz mozFullScreen, mozRequestFullScreen(), etc) but I'm sure it can be easily modified for other browsers.

Second Note: I'm sure this isn't the most efficient way to do this (it still runs perfectly on my pc tho), in fact it's not even close, but I didn't feel like diving into Twitch's javascript stuff so this is how I'm doing it.

Third Note: In case you can't tell by now, I didn't put this on here for you guys, it's for myself in the case that the version in my browser somehow stops existing, but I put this readme here because I felt bad for whomever may stumble upon this.
